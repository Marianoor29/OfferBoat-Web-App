    question: 'Make your payment',
    answer: `When booking a boat through Offerboat, a non-refundable 10% booking fee will be charged by Offerboat. The full charter amount must be paid directly to the boat owner, using any method agreed upon by both parties, or at the dock before boarding. Offerboat’s charges are solely for acilitating the connection between renters and owners.
    
Once you've paid Offerboat's booking fee, the boat owner is immediately notified of your selection, and your information becomes available to them to help coordinate your trip. You will also have access to the owner's details via the Offerboat app, allowing you to contact them directly.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the booking fee?',
    answer: `Offerboat applies a small fee for each booking, which is proportional to the total cost. This fee supports essential protections, including:
    
Instant and secure payment processing, Fraud prevention, Identity verification and protection, customer support from real people
    
The current booking fee is 10% for USD transactions and 13% for transactions in other currencies. Please note, the fee is non-refundable in the case of cancellations, except under extreme circumstances.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'How are additional expenses managed?',
    answer: 'Incidentals charges occur when the renter or guests onboard incur any additional costs, which are uncommon but may include things like minor damages or cleaning fees. If you cause damage to the boat during the rental period, any additional charges must be settled directly with the boat owner. Offerboat does not hold a deposit to cover incidental damages.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is insurance required to rent a boat?',
    answer: `Please be aware that Offerboat bookings do not automatically include insurance for you or your passengers. As a renter, it is important to verify with the boat owner that they have adequate insurance coverage for your booking. In some cases, they may offer insurance for an additional fee.
    
Offerboat does not take responsibility for the safety of renters and their guests while on the water. According to our terms of service, boat operators are fully responsible for ensuring the safety of their passengers and adhering to all local laws and regulations.`
  },
  {
    question: `What is Offerboat's cancellation policy?`,
    answer: `Each listing on Offerboat has its own cancellation policy. Once you accept an offer from an owner, you are agreeing to their specific cancellation terms. If you need to cancel before your trip starts, your refund will be issued according to the owner's cancellation policy.
    
We also recommend that you ask the owner about their COVID-19 cancellation policy and understand how any restrictions might impact your travel plans before booking.
    
Please note that Offerboat's service fees are always non-refundable.`
  },
  {
    question: `Offerboat's Inclusion Policy`,
    answer: `Offerboat is a global, inclusive community dedicated to bringing people together and creating meaningful experiences on the water. As a minority co-founded company with a diverse, distributed team, we are committed to building a platform that fosters acceptance, welcome, and respect for all.
    
We strive to eliminate unlawful discrimination, bias, intolerance, and disrespect, ensuring that people worldwide can enjoy the water. Our community welcomes individuals from all backgrounds.
    
Offerboat boat owners and tour operators are prohibited from:
- Declining a user’s inquiry based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or marital status.
- Canceling a booking based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or marital status.
- Requiring different terms or conditions for bookings based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or marital status.
- Posting any statement or imagery that suggests a preference for or against a user based on these protected characteristics.
    
Boat owners and tour operators who exhibit a pattern of declining guests or canceling bookings from users of these protected classes may face suspension from Offerboat, even if their reasons appear legitimate.

If a listing on Offerboat contains language or imagery that violates our non-discrimination policy, the boat owner or operator will be asked to remove it and review the policy. Additionally, communication with Offerboat customer support or on the platform must not include unlawful bias, discrimination, intolerance, or harassment.

We reserve the right to suspend or remove boat owners from our platform if they violate these standards.`
  },
  {
    question: `Offerboat's COVID-19 and Infectious Diseases Policy`,
    answer: `Our goal at Offerboat is to provide our community with comprehensive guidance while adhering to the advisories from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). We are committed to staying updated on their safety measures and travel requirements, both domestically and internationally.
    
We encourage you to do the same by following the guidance of your federal, state, and local public health officials to ensure your safety and well-being.
    
On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, a global pandemic. In response, we took immediate action to protect our community and offer peace of mind to both our owners and renters. We worked closely with them to reschedule reservations, and many provided refunds when feasible.
    
COVID-19 continues to be a significant concern, and we acknowledge the impact it has had on everyone. We remain dedicated to providing excellent customer service and ensuring a world-class experience for all.
    
We have asked all boat owners and operators to factor COVID-19 into their cancellation policies. If you need to cancel your reservation, you will need to adhere to the cancellation policy of the boat owner or captain.
    
Before booking your reservation, we recommend inquiring about the owner's COVID-19 cancellation policy and understanding how any restrictions might affect your travel plans.
    
Please note that Offerboat's service fees are always non-refundable.`
  },
  {
    question: `Offerboat's Community Guidelines`,
    answer: `
- Do no harm
We are all here to support and grow the global boat rental community. Users whose behavior is counterproductive to this goal may be suspended or removed.
    
- Communication is key
A quick response is a good response. The speed of your replies often correlates with successful transactions. Aim to respond to all messages, inquiries, and offers as promptly as possible. Clear and timely communication helps everyone plan effectively.
    
- Safety first
All boat operators are responsible for knowing and following the rules and regulations that apply to the local areas and waterways they operate in. They must ensure the safety and compliance of their passengers, the vessel, themselves, and fellow boaters. Never compromise on safety or compliance when selecting a boat operator.
    
- We keep it simple
We reserve the right to remove comments that violate these guidelines and to suspend or ban users who repeatedly or intentionally breach them. We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination.
    `
  },
  {
    question: `What types of payment does Offerboat accept?`,
    answer: `To pay for and confirm a booking, Offerboat only accepts credit card payments. Currently, Offerboat accepts the following credit cards:
    
● Visa
● MasterCard
● Visa, MasterCard, & Discover Debit Cards
● American Express
● Discover
● JCB
● Diners Club

Please note that we do not accept prepaid credit cards. `
  },
  {
    question: `Can I use multiple payment methods for a reservation?`,
    answer: `Offerboat cannot currently split the cost of a reservation using multiple payment methods. However, you can easily save multiple payment methods in your account, which is useful if you want to use a business credit card for corporate bookings and a personal credit card for private excursions.
    
If you’re booking a trip with a group of friends, consider using a safe and secure money transfer app to split the cost with your friends or family members.`
  },
  {
    question: `Can I pay outside of Offerboat?`,
    answer: `Absolutely! Nobody likes a middleman! Offerboat only charges a small booking fee to facilitate the connection between you and the best deals with participating boat owners. After that, Offerboat steps aside, allowing you to negotiate the best terms and services directly with the owner. By eliminating the middleman, you have the freedom to save!`
  },
  {
    question: `Can I pay with any currency?`,
    answer: `Offerboat supports payments in over 30 different world currencies for your convenience. The currency you use for payment is generally determined by your payment method and sometimes your country or region. It’s a good idea to check with your credit card company first, as they may charge additional fees if you are paying in a currency different from your country's primary currency.`
  },
  {
    question: `How do I tip my captain?`,
    answer: `Tipping your captain is entirely at your discretion, as with most service-related industries. For boat charters, a tip of 10%-20% is customary.
    
While the captain is responsible for ensuring a safe and enjoyable ride, they are also providing you with an experience and service. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide how much to tip. In some cases, owners may specify a preferred tipping amount in their listing description.`
  },
  {
    question: `Why is my credit card getting declined?`,
    answer: `If your credit card is declined or you're unable to complete payment through our platform, you may want to check the following:
    
● Are your credit card number and billing address entered correctly?
● Is the name on your card entered as it appears on your billing statements?
● Do you have sufficient funds or credit available on your card?
● Is your credit card expired?

If you've verified these details and the card is still being declined, we recommend calling your credit card company or financial institution. Inform them of the transaction amount and that you are trying to book a reservation through Offerboat.
    
In many cases, your bank or credit card company may be blocking the transaction for your security. Once they confirm everything is in order, you should be able to complete your booking.`
  },
  {
    question: `How do I cancel a confirmed booking?`,
    answer: `We understand that unforeseen events can occur, and you may need to cancel a confirmed booking. However, Offerboat is not a party to the actual boat charter, so we cannot assist with cancellations. In these cases, you, as the renter, must communicate with the boat owner as soon as you know you will not be able to board as agreed.

Refunds or credits should be discussed directly with the boat owner, as they may have different policies regarding cancellations. We strongly urge you to ask about and discuss the cancellation process before you pay the owner, ensuring you are comfortable with their terms.`
  },
  {
    question: `Can I cancel if there is bad weather?`,
    answer: `We understand that weather can be unpredictable. In tropical climates, you might experience rain and sunshine throughout the same day.

Cancellations due to weather do happen and are part of the industry, given the risks associated with booking outdoor experiences. Just like other cancellations, weather-related cancellations on Offerboat are subject to the individual owner's cancellation policy.  
  
Most owners typically offer a full refund or a rescheduled date. However, if the conditions are determined to be safe for going out on the water, owners may request payment.
    
While we recognize that some trips are booked with the expectation of good weather, if sea conditions are safe for a charter or rental, canceling due to less-than-ideal weather may not warrant a refund.
    
Most owners are flexible and understanding regarding weather cancellations. However, unless the Coast Guard issues an advisory or prohibits watercraft from going out, any refund request for a weather cancellation must be approved by the owner before they offer a refund.`
  },
  {
    question: `What if the boat owner has to cancel my booking?`,
    answer: `If a boat owner needs to cancel your booking, they should notify Offerboat so that our support team is informed of the cancellation. You can also contact us through the app to notify us that the boat owner has decided to cancel. The boat owner should refund any payment that you may have made to them for the purpose of the charter.

We understand that it’s disappointing when an owner cancels on a customer, but sometimes unforeseen circumstances arise. While Offerboat is not responsible for cancellations made by owners, we are committed to quickly processing 10% booking fee refunds as needed.  
   
Please note that if the cancellation is made in person and we are not contacted (either by email, phone, or through the platform), Offerboat will not be aware of the cancellation and cannot assist.`
  },
  {
    question: `How do I message the boat owner?`,
    answer: `Once your booking is confirmed and payment is completed, contact details for both parties will be provided. You can find the owner's contact information within the app, allowing you to message them directly.`
  },
  {
    question: `Do I need to pay a deposit to hold the reservation?`,
    answer: `Once you have the owner's contact information, it's essential to reach out to them promptly to confirm their deposit policy. The owner will provide details about their preferred payment method, which may include using a secure payment application or paying them dockside on the day of your trip. You'll always have the opportunity to communicate directly with the boat owner.`
  },
  {
    question: `What happens when I accept a trip offer or an owner accepts my custom offer?`,
    answer: `When you accept an offer from an owner, your credit card will be charged a 10% booking fee by Offerboat and both parties will be notified.
    
Once the booking is confirmed, you can contact the owner directly via phone or email to finalize any remaining logistics or details and to pay for the cost of your charter.
    
Additionally, be sure to carefully read the offer and any messages from the owner. Some owners may indicate that there are additional payments required upon arrival that are not included in the booking price. These additional charges could include captain and crew fees, fuel costs, cleaning fees, and gratuity.`
  },
  {
    question: `Why did Offerboat ask for my ID?`,
    answer: `Sometimes, after reviewing your account, Offerboat requires a brief identity verification process. You will receive a secure email link from our verification partners, where you can follow the steps to submit additional information.

Offerboat requests ID for the same reasons you need to show identification when boarding an airplane or booking a hotel room. We aim to ensure that we have the right people on the water while also prioritizing the safety and security of our community.

Please note that if we do not receive a valid ID, Offerboat may cancel a booking in certain cases.

We understand that sending an ID online can feel risky. Rest assured, the information you provide is secure and will never be shared with other Offerboat users. Your data privacy is of the utmost importance to us.`
  },
  {
    question: `Essential Details for Your Upcoming Trip`,
    answer: `Offerboat prioritizes the safety of our community, as well as the well-being of the environment and marine wildlife. As you prepare for your upcoming adventure, please take a moment to review some key information that may address any questions you have.

Is it your first time on a captained charter? Don’t worry! The captain and crew are there to make sure you have a fun and safe experience.
    
Typically, the captain will cover the following important points with all guests on board:

● Life Jackets and PFDs: Instructions on how to use life jackets and personal flotation devices.
● Safety Regulations: Who is required to wear life jackets and/or PFDs according to local, state, and federal laws.
● Overboard Assistance: How to help someone who has fallen overboard.
● Swimming Safety: Guidelines for safe swimming around boats.
● Emergency Equipment: Location of fire extinguishers and emergency equipment.
● Equipment Usage: Identification and explanation of horns, flares, VHF radios, and bilge pumps.
● Emergency Plan: A basic plan for emergencies that may occur on board.

Feel free to ask questions! Boat captains are there to assist you and aim to provide a memorable experience on the water. They’re also a valuable resource if you’re interested in booking charters in the future.
  
If you've booked a bareboat (non-captained) rental, here are some tips and recommendations to ensure your upcoming rental is both safe and enjoyable:
 
● Pack Your Certifications and Licenses

Depending on the type of watercraft and your location, you may need a skipper's license and a license to operate a VHF radio. Some places require completion of a boating education course. Be sure to bring your original paperwork and permits onboard, just in case.
    
● Request a Pre-Rental and Post-Rental Walkthrough

Reach out to the boat owner before your trip to schedule time to review and inspect the equipment for any pre-existing damage. This is similar to renting an apartment! A walkthrough ensures that both you and the owner are aligned on the condition of the watercraft before you take it out.
    
(Here is a sample template for a pre & post-rental watercraft inspection. Note: this is just a guideline and should not be used in place of an official legal document.)
    
● Ask for Local Recommendations

The person handing you the keys and instructions is typically the boat owner, but it might also be a family member, friend, dockmaster, or another trusted individual. Don’t hesitate to ask questions or for recommendations on where to go or what to see. They might offer valuable insider tips for your boat day.
    
● Inquire About Boat Rental Insurance

Offerboat does not provide rental insurance for renters, but you can ask the boat owner if they have insurance that covers bareboat rentals. Additionally, consider checking with an insurance agency that can offer temporary boat rental insurance.
    
By following these tips, you can help ensure a fantastic and safe boating experience!

Make your list and check it twice! It’s easy to forget what you need when preparing for an outing on the water. If you’re unsure what to pack for your boating trip or day on the water, here are our top recommendations:
    
● Packing List for Your Boating Excursion

- Layers: Choose UPF-rated clothing to protect against the sun.
- Complete Change of Clothes: Bring an extra outfit in case you get wet or the weather changes unexpectedly.
- Sunglasses: Protect your eyes from the sun's glare.
- Hat: A wide-brimmed hat can provide additional sun protection.
- Sunscreen: Don’t forget to reapply every two hours or more often if you swim.
- Plenty of Water: Staying hydrated is crucial, so pack enough water for the day.
- Snacks: Bring some easy-to-eat snacks to keep your energy up.
- A Book or Magazine: Disconnect from your smartphone and unwind with some reading.
    
If you’d like to bring items not listed, such as drinks, equipment, or decorations, we recommend contacting the owner beforehand to confirm that these can be brought onboard.

    question: `Boating Safety Basics`,
    answer: `Boating is a wonderful way to explore the water and create lasting memories, but safety should always come first. Here are some essential safety guidelines to keep in mind when you’re out on the water:
    
1. Wear a Life Jacket:
Ensure everyone on board has a properly fitted life jacket. This is crucial even for strong swimmers, as conditions can change unexpectedly.

2. Listen to the Captain:
If you’re on a captained charter, always follow the captain's instructions and guidelines. They are experienced and prioritize your safety.

3. Check Weather Conditions:
Before heading out, check the weather forecast and local warnings. If the conditions seem unsafe, it’s better to postpone your trip.

4. Avoid Running on the Boat:
Always move carefully around the vessel. Wind and waves can shift suddenly, leading to loss of balance and potential injuries.

5. Be Mindful of Your Surroundings:
Watch your step, especially near hatches and companionways. Staying aware of your surroundings can help prevent accidents.

6. Keep a Safe Distance from Other Watercraft:
When swimming or paddling, maintain a safe distance from other boats. Make sure they’re aware that people are in the water.

7. Use the Buddy System:
Count passengers frequently to ensure everyone is accounted for. This is especially important when moving around or swimming.

8. Know Emergency Procedures:
Familiarize yourself with the location of safety equipment like fire extinguishers and first aid kits. Understand the emergency procedures before heading out

9. Avoid Alcohol Consumption:
Refrain from drinking alcohol while boating. Alcohol impairs judgment and reaction times, increasing the risk of accidents.

10. Stay Hydrated and Protect Yourself from the Sun:
Drink plenty of water and apply sunscreen regularly to protect yourself from dehydration and sunburn.
    
By following these boating safety basics, you can ensure a safer and more enjoyable experience on the water. Always prioritize safety and respect the natural environment. Happy boating!`

For bareboat charters, the operator is tasked with providing options for captains, crew, insurance, and/or assessing any captain that the renter may wish to bring along. Renters are responsible for coordinating additional costs, such as fuel, marina fees, and other charges not included in the typical bareboat charter arrangement.
    
Both operators and renters must have all necessary documentation ready for any safety inspections by local, state, or federal authorities. Offerboat does not oversee rentals and cannot ascertain whether a charter qualifies as a bareboat charter.
