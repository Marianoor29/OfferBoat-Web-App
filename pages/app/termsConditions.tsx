                        1. Hey there! Just a heads-up: by using the Offerboat app, you're agreeing to a few key things. First off, Offerboat is basically a matchmaking platform for boat rentals—we're not directly involved in the rental agreements or transactions between renters and boat owners. Our app lets renters check out available boats and connect with owners to make bookings, and remember that everything about the rental itself, from the boat’s condition to payment and safety, is totally between the renter and the owner. So, owners, it's up to you to make sure your boat's ready to go, and renters, you're responsible for handling the rental properly. Offerboat’s here to help you connect, but the rest is on you!
                    </p>

                    <p className="t-2 lg:text-lg md:text-md text-sm ">
                        2. Just so we're clear, by using Offerboat, you're acknowledging that we’re simply a platform—nothing more. We don’t have any direct control over the boats you rent through the app or website. The choices you make, the training you get, and any rules on board are entirely your responsibility, not ours. If anything happens during your rental, you agree not to hold Offerboat accountable for any claims that might come up.

                        3. I confirm that I’m 18 or older and get that only people who meet this age requirement are allowed on the boats. If I don’t meet this standard, I understand I’m not allowed to use the app.

                        4. I understand that the app is intended only for proficient swimmers. I acknowledge that as the renter, it’s my responsibility to ensure that everyone in my party is also a capable swimmer. If anyone in my group isn’t, I won’t access the app or proceed with the rental. Non-swimmers are prohibited from using the app, and I agree to comply with this rule.

                        5. I agree that no alcohol is allowed on the boats, and as the renter, I take full responsibility for ensuring that everyone in my party follows this rule. If I or anyone in my group plans to consume alcohol, I understand that we are prohibited from using the app, and I will refrain from accessing it under those circumstances.

                        6. I acknowledge that wearing a life preserver at all times while on the boat is mandatory. As the renter, I agree to ensure that everyone in my party follows this requirement. If I or anyone in my group does not intend to wear a life preserver, I understand that we are prohibited from using the app and will refrain from accessing it.

                        7. You agree that weapons of any kind are a no-go on the boat. This means no guns, knives, pepper spray, stun guns, tasers, batons, brass knuckles, machetes, swords, or anything else that could be considered a weapon. And as the renter, you’re also responsible for making sure that everyone in your party follows this rule too. Let’s keep it safe and fun!

It's important to follow these requests, except in cases where it could violate your rights. Let's make sure we're all on the right side of the law while enjoying our time on the water!

                        9. You agree that using drones is only allowed in areas where it's legal and never while the boat is moving. If you're flying a drone for commercial purposes, you need to have an FAA Part 107 license and follow all FAA flight requirements, including any notifications and restrictions. Also, you must inform the boat owner about your intention to fly a drone from their boat and get their approval before doing so. You assume all responsibility for any damages caused by the drone in case of an accident involving property or people. If you're using the drone commercially, you agree to add Offerboat as an additional insured on a policy of no less than $1 million USD. Make sure to list Offerboat at 1951 NW S River Drive, Miami, FL 33125 as an additional insured, and email the insurance certificate to support@offerboat before your flight. Let’s keep it safe and enjoyable for everyone!

Make sure to list Offerboat at 1951 S River Drive, Miami, FL 33125, and email the certificate to support@offerboat.com. Let’s keep everything above board while you’re working!

                        13. You agree that moving from the aft to the bow, or vice versa, while the boat is underway is not allowed. You can only transition between the bow and aft when the boat is stationary. If you plan to move around while the boat is moving, you’re not permitted to use Offerboat. To keep everyone safe, renters should stay in the same area while the boat is underway to minimize the risk of falling overboard. Let’s make sure we all stay safe and have a great time!

You understand that getting too close to the propellers poses a major risk that could cause great bodily harm or death. Let’s keep it safe and enjoy our time on the water!

                        37. Just so we’re clear, if anything happens—like an accident or someone gets hurt while
                        you're using a rented boat—it’s all on you. Whether it’s a collision or an injury, you’ll be
                        responsible for it. So, let’s make sure to be careful and avoid any issues while out on the

                        the app. By renting, you’re accepting the risks that come with a boat that might not be in
                        perfect shape. It's a good idea to double-check things yourself to make sure everything’s
                        in order before heading out!

                        using the app, you accept any risks that come with relying on this information. Make sure

                        your area. Renters, please double-check that the boat you rent meets all legal and
                        safety standards. Both Members and Renters are responsible for following these
                        requirements.

                        condition using the supplies provided.

                        56. Before you book or purchase anything, just a heads up that you’ll need to sign a
                        separate agreement or waiver with the Member. These agreements might have some
                        extra rules for your booking, so it’s good to be aware. Also, any agreements about
                        renting a boat or related services are entirely between you and the Member.

                        57. If there's ever a disagreement between a Renter and a Member, we want to make it
                        clear that both of you agree to keep Offerboat out of it. Essentially, you both take
                        responsibility for any claims, losses, or legal issues that might arise from the situation.
                        This includes anything related to the terms of this agreement, other agreements, or any
                        issues with the rental units. And just to clarify, both the Member and the Renter are on
                        the hook for any claims that might come up because of your actions—whether that's
                        breaking the rules we’ve set, running into legal issues, or any problems that pop up while
                        using Offerboat's services. We designed this to protect Offerboat as much as legally
                        possible, so everyone can enjoy a smooth sailing experience!

                        Any insurance that you might have is your own deal and doesn't involve Offerboat at all.
                        We really recommend that you look into getting the right insurance to cover any potential
                        risks related to your rental—this could include anything from personal safety to
                        protecting your belongings or making sure your trip goes smoothly on the day you
                        choose. It’s all about keeping you and your experience safe!

                        intended for, you're doing it at your own risk. It’s up to you to make sure you're following
                        any local laws that apply. Stay safe out there!

                        HIPAA or FISMA. If you’re in a situation where those apply, it’s best not to use our
                        services. Also, we want to make sure you’re not using our services in a way that goes
                        against the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). We appreciate your understanding!
                        61. Our services are all about making it easy for you to list and book boats. When it comes
                        to the boats, they’re listed by their Owners right here on our platform. You can check out
                        the listings as a guest, but if you want to book a boat or create your own listing, you’ll
                        need to register for an Offerboat account first.

                        Offerboat doesn’t control what goes into the listings or the condition, legality, or suitability
                        of the boats. Because of that, we can’t take any responsibility for the listings or the boats
                        themselves. So, just keep in mind that all bookings are made at your own risk, whether
                        you're the Renter or the Owner. Happy boating!

                        64. Before you jump into using our services, let’s go over some important things you need to
                        agree to. First off, if you’re going to operate a boat, make sure you have the right skills
                        and are legally authorized to do so in the area where you’re renting. And remember,
                        don’t let anyone else operate the boat unless they’re also qualified! You also need to
                        have the legal authority to make binding commitments and promise to use our services
                        according to our terms. You're here to post or view boat rentals and handle legitimate
                        rental transactions for yourself or someone you’re authorized to act for, so if you’re
                        booking for someone else, be sure to inform them about the terms and conditions and
                        any laws they should know about. If they need to sign a separate rental agreement,
                        that’s on you to make sure it happens. Always provide us with accurate, truthful, current,
                        and complete information, and if you have an Offerboat account, keep your login info
                        safe and confidential. You’ll need to follow all laws regarding boat operation,
                        maintenance, rental, or charter, and if you’re listing a boat, confirm that you’re either the
                        legal owner or an authorized representative of the owner. And just a heads up, you can’t
                        share your account with anyone else or transfer it to someone else. If you’re in an area
                        with age restrictions, follow those rules and remember that our services are only
                        available to those 18 and over, so by using them, you confirm you meet that age
                        requirement. Lastly, Offerboat reserves the right to deny access to our services at any
                        time for any reason, including if the terms aren’t being followed.

                        65. As a Renter, you’ll need to create an account and set up your payment info for our
                        service fees and any other fees that might come up when you book. It’s super important
                        that you provide all the necessary details, including a valid credit card for
                        pre-authorization, reservations, and payments.When you book through Offerboat, you'll
                        be paying your booking service fees to us so we can connect you with the boat owner
                        who listed their boat on our app. Just so you know, when you give us your credit card
                        info, you're agreeing to a 10% non-refundable booking service fee. This fee doesn’t go
                        toward the rental costs that the boat owner may require. We may use a trusted
                        third-party service provider to securely store your credit card information to help us
                        process payments. By sharing your info with us, you’re okay with that! We promise to
                        work with providers who have strong security measures in place to keep your information
                        safe.

                        66. Just a heads up: Offerboat isn’t part of any agreements between you and the boat
                        owners. We don’t handle payment collections for rentals, so it’s up to you as the Renter
                        to make sure payments go directly to the boat owner for any rentals you arrange through
                        our platform. If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask! We're here to help.

                        important to remember that sharing personal contact information—like email addresses,
                        phone numbers, website links, company names, social media accounts, pickup
                        locations, or any other ways to communicate directly outside of Offerboat—is a no-go.

                        seems like it might go around our platform or violate our terms. If these rules aren’t
                        followed, it could lead to your account being suspended or removed from Offerboat, and
                        that’s totally up to us.

                        allowed.

                        same condition you found it. We know you’ll take good care of it! Just so you know,
                        you’re responsible for everything that happens to the boat while it’s in your hands,
                        including any actions by your guests.

                        you’re on board. Both you and the boat owner agree to keep us out of any issues that
                        might come up. So, if anything goes awry, you’re all set to handle it directly with the boat
                        owner.

                        76. Hey there! We wanted to give you a heads-up about our Booking Fee. When you use the
                        Offerboat app, there’s a service fee of up to 10% of the total rental amount. This fee
                        helps us connect you with the boat owner but doesn’t go toward the actual cost of
                        renting the boat. You’re responsible for covering the full rental costs directly to the boat
                        owners.

                        77. When it comes to payments, we’ve got you covered! Offerboat will handle any currency
                        conversions for you. Most transactions are processed in US dollars unless we specify
                        otherwise. Just a quick note: a currency conversion fee of 3% of the total rental amount
                        will apply, and we might adjust the conversion rate based on when you make the
                        payment.

                        78. Also, keep in mind that we may modify our Transaction Fees from time to time. If we do
                        make any changes, they’ll take effect on your next booking after the adjustment. Don’t
                        worry; any rentals you’ve already booked will stick to the fees that were in place when
                        you made that booking. Thanks for being part of the Offerboat family! We hope you have
                        a fantastic experience out on the water!

                        79. Just a quick note: Offerboat doesn’t handle or process any payments to boat owners for
                        rentals made through our app. It’s up to you and the boat owner to work out the payment
                        details and ensure everything is agreed upon. We’re not part of the actual rental
                        transaction or the money transfer, so you and the owner will coordinate directly on that
                        front. Thanks for understanding, and happy boating!

                        80. If a boat owner doesn’t respond to your booking inquiry, we may step in and reassign the
                        booking to another owner on your behalf. We want to make sure you have a smooth
                        experience!

                        81. We also take your safety seriously, so if we have any reasonable suspicions of
                        fraudulent activity or anything unusual related to the rental or payment process, we
                        reserve the right to remove members.

                        83. We want to make sure you have a great experience, so it’s good to know that sometimes
                        the boats or watercraft you’ve reserved might need repairs or could be unavailable for
                        your reservation. If that happens, don’t worry! The boat owner may offer you a substitute
                        that closely matches the age, size, model, and value of the original boat you wanted.
                        We’re here to help ensure you still have a fantastic time on the water!

                        84. Just a quick heads-up: Offerboat isn’t involved in the actual transaction between you and
                        the boat owner, so we don’t handle any payments related to your boat rental. This
                        means we also don’t collect any taxes or fees that might be required by local, state, or
                        federal authorities.

                        85. So, both you and the boat owner are responsible for your own tax obligations. If you’re
                        the boat owner who accepted a booking, you’ll need to manage the collection, reporting,
                        and payment of any taxes that apply. It’s a great idea to check in with your legal or tax
                        advisors if you have any questions about that.

                        You’ll also need to take care of reporting that, too. Thanks for understanding, and happy

                        best, we can’t take responsibility for confirming the identities of every Renter or Member.
                        That said, we might ask you for some reasonable proof of identity, so we appreciate your
                        cooperation with that!

                        you get any messages from someone asking for your online ID or password, please

          for any transactions that happen under your Offerboat account or email, even if they

          there won't be any security hiccups along the way. The Services are here for you on an

          upfront: to the fullest extent allowed by law, we don’t offer any guarantees or
          warranties—express or implied—about the Services. This includes things like implied
          warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. While we strive for

          perfect. If something goes wrong—like personal injury, property damage, or even pesky
          bugs and viruses—you agree that we’re not liable. We also can’t take responsibility for

          accuracy of the info shared by Renters or Members, or whether boat rentals will actually
          be available at the advertised times, locations, or prices—even if your reservation is
          confirmed. There’s no guarantee that the boats will meet legal or safety standards, and
          your experience with the Services might not meet your specific needs or expectations.
          Plus, we can’t promise that the Services will always run smoothly, on time, or without any
          errors. While you might find information through the Services, we can’t vouch for its
          accuracy or reliability, and we don’t guarantee that any software we provide will be free
          of bugs. Just a heads-up: some places might not allow these types of exclusions or

          else—aren't liable for any direct or indirect damages you might face while using our
          Services. This includes anything from issues with advertised boat rentals to any data
          hiccups, even if we were warned about the possibility. If you rely on ads or get into a
          deal with someone you found through our platform, that’s on you. We also can’t be held
          responsible for any modifications we make to our Services, any interruptions you
          experience, or if you don’t keep your account info secure. Also, if something goes wrong
          during a boat rental—like an accident—know that Offerboat isn’t part of that rental
          agreement and isn’t responsible for injuries or damages. Your rental is at your own risk,
          and if we were ever found liable for something, our total responsibility would be limited to
          either the service fees you paid or a maximum of $100. Just keep in mind that some
          places might not allow these limits, so this may not apply everywhere.

          Offerboat and its team—like our directors, officers, agents, and employees—by covering

          everything from legal fees to any other expenses related to the issue. It doesn’t matter
          whether the claims are known or unknown, as this protection covers disputes about
          breaches of this Agreement, other agreements, or issues with rental units. Plus, both the
          Renter and Member also agree to hold Offerboat harmless from claims related to their
          violation of these Terms, any applicable laws, or infringement of anyone else's rights,
          along with their use of the Services. Just so you know, Offerboat isn’t obligated to step in

                    104. If a court finds that any part of these Terms is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, no
          worries! The rest of the Terms will still be good to go. We’ll make sure to interpret the
          valid sections in a way that reflects the original vibe of the part that didn’t quite fit. So,
          we’re all about keeping things smooth and ensuring the spirit of the Terms stays strong!

                    112. Let's break down what we mean by these terms in a friendly way! A “Bareboat
          Rental” is basically when you sign an agreement to take full control of a boat for your
          adventures, which means you're responsible for everything from manning it to stocking it
          with supplies during your rental period. When we say “Boat(s),” we’re talking about any
          type of marine vessel you might want to rent. Now, “Offerboat Content” includes all the
          cool stuff we provide through our services—think text, images, videos, and more—while
          “Collective Content” is a mix of both Offerboat Content and any material contributed by
          our awesome Members. Speaking of Members, a “Renter” is someone who books a boat
          through us, while an “Owner” is the one managing that boat listing and making sure
          everything goes smoothly. A “Listing” is just a boat that’s available for rent. “Member
          Content” is all the stuff you upload or share with us, and our “Service Fee Policy”
          outlines the fees you might encounter during your transactions. A “Time Charter” is when
          the boat owner keeps responsibility for running the boat but lets you enjoy it. Lastly, “Tax”
          covers any sales or service taxes that might apply. Just remember, some sections of our
          services might have their own specific rules, and if there’s ever a conflict, those will take
          precedence. Happy boating!

          download or print any of our accessible content for your personal, non-commercial use.
          Just a heads-up, though: unless we say otherwise, you can’t copy, reproduce, distribute,

          "PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES" part before diving into our Services so you can fully grasp
          (a) the rights you’re giving us and (b) the responsibilities you take on when you share or
          upload any content. When you send us questions, comments, ideas, or feedback about
          our Services (let’s call these "Submissions"), you’re giving us all the intellectual property
          rights tied to them. That means Offerboat can own and use those Submissions however
          we like—commercially or otherwise—without needing to credit or compensate you. Plus,
          when you interact with our Services through chats, blogs, or forums, you might create
          what we call "Contributions," which could include everything from text and videos to
          photos and personal info. Just a heads-up: anything you post publicly will be visible to
          other users, so keep that in mind!

          Legal Terms—no prior notice needed. If we do decide to take action, we might also

          important to keep your password safe and confidential. You’re responsible for all the
          activity that happens with your account and password. If we ever find that your

          It’s also a no-go to mess with our security features or use the Services in a way that

          don’t use it for commercial purposes or let others access it simultaneously. If you're
          downloading the App from the Apple Store or Google Play, keep in mind that your use is
          also subject to their rules. We're here to provide maintenance and support, but the App
          Distributors aren’t obligated to do so. If there are issues with the App, they might refund

          we won’t hesitate to take action, which might include reporting them to law enforcement.
          We can also choose to limit your access to or even disable your Contributions if we think
          it’s necessary. Additionally, if any files or content are too large or causing issues for our

          heads-up: we have the right to deny access to anyone at our discretion, without any
          notice or liability, for any reason—or even no reason at all. This includes blocking
          specific IP addresses if necessary. If we find a breach of any part of these Terms or
          applicable laws, we can terminate your access to the Services or delete your account
          and any content you posted, all without warning. If we do need to suspend or terminate

          Services whenever we feel like it—no notice required! While we do our best to keep
          things updated, we're not obligated to refresh every piece of info all the time. We might
          also tweak or discontinue parts of the Services, and we won’t be held responsible for any
          changes, price shifts, or if something is temporarily unavailable. Sometimes, we might
          run into hardware or software hiccups or need to do some maintenance, which could
          cause interruptions. Just a heads-up: we can revise or update things whenever
          necessary, and you agree that we’re not liable for any inconvenience if you can’t access
          the Services during those times. In short, we’re here to provide a great experience, but

          Terms (we'll call them "Disputes"), both you and we agree to take a friendly approach
          first. Before diving into arbitration, let’s give informal negotiations a shot for at least thirty
          (30) days. This way, we can try to sort things out together without jumping into a more
          formal process. Just a heads-up: these informal talks will kick off once one of us sends
          written notice to the other. It’s all about working things out the easy way first!

          Terms or the use of our Services (we’ll refer to these as “Disputes”), you and Offerboat
          agree to go the arbitration route. This means we’ll settle things through binding
          arbitration rather than in court, except for cases where either of us needs to seek
          injunctive or equitable relief to protect our intellectual property rights. Just a heads-up: by
          agreeing to this, you’re waiving your right to a jury trial or to be part of any class action
          lawsuits. Also, unless we both agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator can’t combine
          claims from different people or oversee class actions. If this part about consolidation isn’t
          enforceable, then the whole “Dispute Resolution” section will be void, but don’t
          worry—this section will stick around even if our agreement ends.

                    129. When it comes to resolving any disputes about these Terms or our Services, you and
          Offerboat agree to go the binding arbitration route instead of heading to court—this
          means waving goodbye to jury trials and class actions! If we need to make a change to

          take care of any corrections and keep everything up to date without prior notice. Just
          remember, if a dispute arises, you’ll need to bring it up within one year, or it’s off the
          table!
